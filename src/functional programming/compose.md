The two `compose` functions you provided are similar in functionality, but there is a subtle difference in their implementation. Let's break down the differences:

### First `compose` function:

```javascript
const compose = (f, g) => (...args) => f(g(...args));

function purchasedItem(...fns) {
  return fns.reduce(compose);
}
```

### Second `compose` function:

```javascript
const compose =
  (...fns) =>
  (...args) =>
    fns.reduce((acc, curr) => acc(curr(...args)));
```

#### Key differences:

1. **Argument Passing:**
   - In the first `compose` function, the result of applying function `g` to the arguments is passed as separate arguments to function `f`.
   - In the second `compose` function, the result of applying function `curr` to the arguments is passed as a single argument to the accumulator `acc`.

2. **Parentheses and Return:**
   - In the first `compose` function, parentheses are used to explicitly group the operations, and there's an explicit `return` statement.
   - In the second `compose` function, the arrow functions are concise, and there's no explicit `return` statement. The result is implicitly returned.

#### Example:

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the difference:

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const multiplyBy2 = (x) => x * 2;

// Using the first compose function
const composed1 = compose(add, multiplyBy2);

// Using the second compose function
const composed2 = compose(add, multiplyBy2);

console.log(composed1(3, 4)); // Output: 10 (add(multiplyBy2(3, 4)))
console.log(composed2(3, 4)); // Output: 14 (add(multiplyBy2(3, 4)))
```

In the example, the second `compose` function would result in a different output because it passes the result of `multiplyBy2(3, 4)` as a single argument to `add`, whereas the first `compose` function passes the result as separate arguments. The specific choice between these two versions depends on the expected behavior and requirements of your use case.
